<span style="font-size: 2em;"> **Me As A Developer:** </span>
- I want to make games that I and other will enjoy playing for hours on end.
- Great games are made from a place of passion, mediocre games are made from a place of profit.
- The possibility for games that can be made is endless, many developrs don't take risks like they used to. I want to create games that stand out from the cookie cutters in the industry.
